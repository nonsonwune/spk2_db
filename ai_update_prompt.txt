Project Context Management Instructions

1. Initial Context Loading
   - ALWAYS read ai_update.txt at /Users/nonsonwune/Desktop/jamb_projects/spk2_db/ai_update.txt at the start of each session
   - Use this information to understand the current state of the project
   - Note the most recent changes and active development areas

2. Project Structure
   Main Components:
   - Data Importer (importer/data_importer.go)
   - Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
   - Analysis Tools (main.go)
   - Configuration (.env)

3. Key Features to Maintain:
   - Batch Processing
   - Transaction Management
   - Error Handling
   - Progress Tracking
   - Data Validation
   - Column Mapping

4. Update Log Maintenance
   When updating ai_update.txt, include:
   - Date [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - WHAT: Detailed list of changes made
   - WHY: Rationale behind changes
   - TECHNICAL DETAILS:
     * Implementation specifics
     * Performance considerations
     * Error handling improvements
     * Database optimizations
   - Modified files (prefix with ~)
   - Dependencies added/updated
   - Schema changes
   - New features or capabilities

5. Database Information
   - Main DB: postgresql://jamb_user:Jamb123@localhost:5432/jamb_db
   - New DB: postgresql://jamb_user:Jamb123@localhost:5432/jamb_db_v2
   - Schema: Includes tables for candidates, courses, institutions, etc.
   - Key Operations: Import, Analysis, Reporting

6. Code Standards
   - Use Go best practices
   - Maintain comprehensive error handling
   - Include progress indicators for long operations
   - Implement context-based cancellation
   - Use batch processing for large datasets
   - Preserve data integrity with COALESCE

7. Project Goals
   - Efficient data import
   - Accurate analysis
   - Robust error handling
   - Performance optimization
   - Data quality maintenance
   - Comprehensive reporting

Remember: This is a critical system for JAMB (Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board) data management. All changes must prioritize data integrity and system reliability.
